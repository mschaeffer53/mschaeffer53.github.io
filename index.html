    <h2> Alligator Swamped with Questions after Questionable Incident!</h2>
    <p>  Tallahassee, Florida - A large alligator bit a man's butt last week. <br />
    The man sued the gator for sexual harassment and they settled <br />
    out of swamp. The disgruntled alligator issued a brief statement this morning. <br />
        "The whole allegation was a croc of shit. Why would I be interested in <br />
        a man's butt? I have reptile dysfunction," said Al A. Gator.</p>

        This isn't the first time gators have been in legal trouble recently.
